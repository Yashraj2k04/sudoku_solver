login logic (dummy login) is done, buttons update as per login status.
i.e, :  login -> play game 
        play as guest -> logout
    and vice versa.

made login page look a bit better then the clanky version from before.

we will not be using qtcreator, and rather, will be using pure cpp for styling and transitions. 
qtcreator creates .ui files and i didnt know it before i made basic ui in cpp.
    going a hybrid approach is hella tedious, makes the cpp and ui files override each other.

basic cpp for styling, transition etc incoming.
